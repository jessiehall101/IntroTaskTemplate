            <p>At my workplace, we use both Teams and Slack to communicate. Slack is mainly used within the Tech department - that’s where I message my team. 
                <br> Teams is used across the wider company, so if I need to contact anyone outside of Tech, I’ll message them on there.

            <h2><span class="stage-title">Email</span></h2>
            <img src="./Images/Icons/google-gmail.webp">
            <p>Email is used for company-wide updates, communicating with people outside the business, or when something needs to be sent formally.</p>

            <h2><span class="stage-title">Video Call</span></h2>
            <img src="./Images/Icons/google-meets.webp">
            <p>I video call at least once a day with my team during our daily standup, where we share progress updates. We also have a few regular video calls throughout the week. 
                <br> If I’m pairing with someone on a ticket, we’ll jump into a Slack huddle so we can talk things through and solve it quicker.
                <br> If something urgent comes up, it's also best to jump on a video call so the problem can be solved promptly.

            <h2><span class="stage-title">Face-to-Face</span></h2>
            <img src="./Images/Icons/face-to-face.png">
            <p>Face-to-face works best when there’s a lot to cover in a meeting, or if multiple people need to speak. For example, we run our fortnightly sprint ceremonies in person so that everyone has a chance to talk and we can catch up properly.  </p>
